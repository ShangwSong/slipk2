# This example shows how to add a k2 distribution on top
# of the low frequency slip distribution of L'Aquila earthquake
# obtained by an inversion (Cirella et al. 20??)
# The slip distribution is sampled at 100 m for 281x176 squares.
# The normalization target is the moment (it may be the stress
# drop).
# The k2 part is simulated with a fractal distribution of 20000
# cracks with radius spanning from 10 m up to .2*faultwidth.
# As this LF distribution exists, the gaussian number is set to
# 0 and a p.tmp file is present in the tmp directory.
# run "slipk2 input=paramforslip" and Voila. The result is the
# file tmp/d.tmp.
# You can visualize it with gnuplot for example :
# plot 'd.tmp' binary array=(281,176) scan=yx flipy with image

# To create your own probability function, you may use a sum of
# gaussian function. Each gaussian is defined by the coordinates
# of its centre on the fault plane, its sigma and its weight. To
# test it, just comment with a # the line above and uncomment the
# three next lines. Warning ... Doing that, the original p.tmp will
# be overwritten.
